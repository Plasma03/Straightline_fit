# Learn how to fit data
While I was learning this I had to learn Github first and I came to know one if we put one hashtag infornt of word it's fornt size is bigger than words with two to six hashtags. Two hashtags are the samllest in size.
If we want to bold the word we need to put  two astrick sign in the start and end of word. If you want to convert in itlacis put one astick at the start and end of world. If you want ot insert hyperlink in the world fot big bracket for world followed by small barckat with link, it will give you that link embeded in that word. If we want ot load image put exclamation sign infront of small bracket inside which you have image name.
